## **Intro**

WTWR (What to Wear) is a weather-based clothing recommendation web application built with React. The primary goal of this project is to provide users with smart outfit suggestions based on the current weather conditions and time of day, using real-time data from the OpenWeather API.

The application demonstrates practical use of modern frontend technologies, including:

-  React functional components and hooks
  
-  React Context API for global state management
  
-  Dynamic styling based on weather conditions
  
-  RESTful API integration
  
-  Component reusability and modular design

By combining weather data and user-interaction features, WTWR serves as both a practical utility and a showcase of responsive, state-driven UI design.
